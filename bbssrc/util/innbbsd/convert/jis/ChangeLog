	* Stepped up version number to 0.11.

	* Changed "out:" two "out:;" and cleaned up the Makefile, this
	works for all cases.  Email from andrew@research.att.com.

	* Partially corrected the handling of the swicthes, the result of
	strcmp() can be positive and negative as we know. :-)

	* Added the correct codes in the initialization of
	codes_for_named_characters for jis, big, and gb.  IBM remains.

	* Added a stupid exit(0) after the label out, since having a label
	just at the end of the block causes and error in gcc 1.*.  The
	real fix should be to change the way the switches are parsed!

	* Stepped up the version number from 0.0 to 0.1.  Added tentative
	manual and GPL statements.
