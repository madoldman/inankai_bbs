   Cool features of innbbsd: adding filters

1. Install
  a. cd convert/hztty; make; make sys-type
  b. modify Makeifle, 
     choose one of the LAN options:
#LANG=BIG5
#LANG=GB
#LANG=ENGLISH

     uncomment out
#FILTER=
#FILTEROBJ=

  c. modify innd/filter.ctl
     to clarify as examples:
tw.bbs.*,alt.chinese.text.big5:big2gb:gb2big
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^
newsgroups in wildcard pattern  ^       ^
and separated with ",".         |       |
			      receive  send
                              filter   filter

Three types of filters:
1. builtin
2. pipe stream of builtin filter
3. external commands

Available builtin filters
gb2big, big52gb, hz2gb, hz2big 

Useful external command filters
j2b (jis2big), b2j(big2jis) 

Successful testing:
builtin: 
  receive: big2gb, hz2gb, hz2big
  send:    gb2big, /usr/local/bin/b2g|/usr/local/bin/gb2hz
external:
  receive: /usr/local/bin/j2b
  send:    /usr/local/bin/b2j
